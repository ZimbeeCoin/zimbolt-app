🚀 Zimbolt Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
⚡ General
What are the best AI models for Zimbolt?
For the best coding experience, we recommend:

Claude 3.5 Sonnet – Best all-around model for structured code generation.
GPT-4o – Strong competitor to Claude, excels in natural language processing and complex coding tasks.
Gemini 1.5 Pro – High-speed model with solid performance in full-stack development.
DeepSeek Chat V3 – Best open-source alternative for AI-assisted coding and Web3 applications.
Qwen 2.5 Coder 32B – The best self-hosted model with reasonable hardware requirements.
⚠️ Important: Models with less than 7B parameters struggle with advanced coding tasks. Use larger models for Web3, DeFi, and complex full-stack applications.

How can I get the best results with Zimbolt?
To maximize efficiency, follow these best practices:

🔹 Specify your tech stack upfront

Include relevant frameworks and languages in your prompt, such as Solidity, React, Vite, Tailwind, Hardhat, Next.js.
This helps Zimbolt generate code tailored to your exact requirements.
🔹 Use the "Enhance" feature

Click the Enhance button before submitting your prompt.
Zimbolt will refine your request to improve accuracy and clarity.
🔹 Start with a basic scaffold, then expand

Generate the foundational structure of your app first.
Once the core functionality is in place, add advanced features in stages.
🔹 Batch simple instructions

Instead of multiple small prompts, combine actions in one request:
Example: “Convert this to TypeScript, add a wallet connect button, and make it mobile-responsive.”

🔍 Troubleshooting & Common Issues
🛑 "There was an error processing this request"
This is a generic error. Check:

The terminal logs (if running via Docker or pnpm).
The browser’s developer console (F12 → Console tab).
🔑 "x-api-key header missing"
Restart the Docker container or pnpm process.
If that doesn’t work, try switching between Docker & pnpm.
⚪ Blank preview in UI
Open the browser’s developer console and check for errors.
If the AI-generated code is incorrect, reset the session and retry.
💾 "Everything works, but the output is incorrect"
If using local models, switch to Claude 3.5 Sonnet or GPT-4o for better accuracy.
For Web3 applications, provide detailed instructions (e.g., “Use ethers.js to sign transactions”).
💻 Windows-Specific Errors
Structured Exception #0xc0000005 (Access Violation)

Update your Visual C++ Redistributable.
Miniflare/Wrangler errors on Windows

Ensure you have Visual Studio C++ 14.40.33816 installed.
